This the source code for [Tradeswipe](https://tradeswipe-mit.com), a web app for MIT students to buy/sell meal swipes. I originally made this project for Web Lab, and later redesigned/extended it before releasing.

Credits to Web Lab staff for the skeleton, which made configuration and Google authentication much less of a headache.
