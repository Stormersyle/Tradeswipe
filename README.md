This the source code for [Tradeswipe](https://tradeswipe-mit.com), a web app for MIT students to buy/sell meal swipes. I originally made this project for Web Lab, and later redesigned/extended it before releasing.

Stack: React frontend, Express/Node API and backend, MongoDB database. SocketIO for live updates and live chat.

Credits to Web Lab staff for the skeleton, which made Node configuration and Google authentication less of a headache. Also credits to Gabriel R for helping with Touchstone auth.
